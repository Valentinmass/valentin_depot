	abstract = {The welfare of farm animals is a complex concept that is intrinsically linked to the animal's perception of its environment. Although welfare cannot be measured directly, it can be assessed by identifying and quantifying specific indicators according to the context of the assessment. Animal behaviour, widely recognized as a key welfare indicator, responds dynamically to changes in the rearing environment, such as access to pasture, which affect both the routine and spatial dynamics of the animals. The analysis of these behavioural changes allows the identification of new indicators and the negative or positive impact of these environmental changes on animal welfare. The integration of sensor technologies, mathematical models and artificial intelligence opens new avenues for longitudinal monitoring of activities, spatial dynamics and other parameters of interest throughout an animal's life cycle. For example, supervised classification algorithms have enabled the association of raw sensor data with specific behaviours, while unsupervised algorithms are expected to reveal novel indicators. This article explores the potential opportunities offered by digital technologies. We highlight the role of behavioural assessment in welfare assessment, illustrated by three case studies: (1) discriminating pathological, reproductive or stress conditions in cows, (2) lameness prediction in dairy cows, and (3) the study of emotions in pigs. Finally, we highlight the importance of close interdisciplinary collaboration between ethologists, physiologists, mathematicians and computer scientists to advance this emerging field, which we term 'digital ethology'.},

	abstract = {Precision Livestock Farming techniques have been developed essentially to increase profitability and reduce workload by applying automatic
processes to monitor animals and their environment. For instance detecting oestrus allows timely insemination, while detecting lameness at an
early stage or imbalance in the nutritional status or even abnormal ambiance parameters in the barn can help take remedial actions quickly.
The data generated by Precision Livestock Farming sensors could also support animal welfare. A system detecting health problems (e.g. mastitis,
ketosis in dairy cows) can be part of welfare management. In addition and maybe more importantly, some Precision Livestock Farming devices are
based on animal behaviour detection directly, or indirectly through the position of animals: time spent feeding, ruminating, resting, walking, etc.
Subtle changes in behaviour can indicate the mental state of an animal hyper-reactivity vs. apathy, social isolation, changes in the daily rhythm
of activity, reduction in play behaviour and grooming, hyper-agressivity. These changes can be all signs of malaise due to disease, stress, social
instability, etc. We argue that Precision Livestock Farming techniques offer a wide range of possibilities to use animal behavioural signs to address
animal welfare in modern livestock farming, be the welfare related to health status, social relations, human-animal relationship or more general
effects of a stressful environment. At present, these possibilities have been little explored, and they deserve more research. In addition, the use of
Precision Livestock Farming is changing farmers’ work and potentially their interactions with animals. It is necessary that the animals remain at
the centre of attention if one wants to address adequately their welfare in harmony with the farmer.},

	abstract = {In response to the sustainability issues that agriculture faces in advanced economies, agroecology has gained increasing relevance in scientific, political, and social debates. This has promoted discussion about transitions to agroecology, which represents a significant advancement. Accordingly, it has become a growing field of research. We reviewed the literature on and in support of farm transitions to agroecology in advanced economies in order to identify key research challenges and suggest innovative research paths. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Research that supports exploration and definition of desired futures, whether based on future-oriented modeling or expert-based foresight approaches, should more explicitly include the farm level. It should stimulate the creativity and design ability of farmers and other stakeholders, and also address issues of representation and power among them. (2) Research that creates awareness and assesses farms before, during or after transition requires more holistic and dynamic assessment frameworks. These frameworks need to be more flexible to adapt to the diversity of global and local challenges. Their assessment should explicitly include uncertainty due to the feedback loops and emergent properties of transitions. (3) Research that analyzes and supports farms during transition should focus more on the dynamics of change processes by valuing what happens on the farms. Research should especially give more credence to on-farm experiments conducted by farmers and develop new tools and methods (e.g., for strategic monitoring) to support these transitions. This is the first review of scientific studies of farm transitions to agroecology. Overall, the review indicates that these transitions challenge the system boundaries, temporal horizons, and sustainability dimensions that agricultural researchers usually consider. In this context, farm transitions to agroecology require changes in the current organization and funding of research in order to encourage longer term and more adaptive configurations.},

	abstract = {This review was conducted to demonstrate how artificial intelligence (AI) has affected livestock farming. Livestock is essential for maintaining ecological integrity and providing food security. In this review, the history of artificial intelligence (AI), its impact on current and future livestock farming, and its drawbacks have been highlighted. The term “artificial intelligence,” was first coined by John McCarthy in 1956, and currently, the technology is widely applied in the management of many livestock farms like poultry, dairy, and pigs. Although it has been studied for decades and widely applied, AI is still one of the least understood subfields. Artificial intelligence provides farmers with unrivalled support, enabling them to minimize resource use, improve the sustainability of their feeding patterns, and increase farm productivity in general, especially when it comes to reducing the carbon footprint. AI is a blessing for boosting efficiency and productivity while also lowering the possibility of human error. Producers can use artificial intelligence to simulate human decision-making and provide interpretations and solutions for the data gathered by sensors and other hardware technologies. Through AI tools, it is possible to easily trace animal activities and locations and collect data about behaviors, habitats, and health conditions. Animal identification, animal welfare monitoring, sex determination, vaccine delivery, and pasture evaluation are some areas where AI has been widely applied so far. Drones, robots, and blockchains are some forms of automation that have been widely used in dairy farms. However, the expense of development, which needs more infrastructure on the farm, and the potential for automation to replace them are the limitations of the technology.},

	abstract = {Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques, including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP{\textbackslash}@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory. Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7\% and 99.3\% in two benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99\% and near-zero identity switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction through activity quantification and behavioural classification.},

This FAIR compliant resource addresses major Big Data challenges - volume (90 hours of recordings, 65.6 GB), variety (multi farm and multi zone acoustics), velocity (real time processing), and veracity (noise robust feature extraction). Our distributed processing framework integrates advanced denoising using iZotope RX, multimodal synchronization through audio and video alignment, and standardized feature engineering with 24 acoustic descriptors generated from Praat, librosa, and openSMILE. Preliminary benchmarks reveal distinct class level acoustic patterns for estrus detection, distress classification, and maternal communication. The datasets ecological realism, reflecting authentic barn acoustics rather than controlled settings, ensures readiness for field deployment. This work establishes a foundation for animal centered AI, where bioacoustic data enable continuous and non invasive welfare assessment at industrial scale. By releasing standardized pipelines and detailed metadata, we promote reproducible research that connects Big Data analytics, sustainable agriculture, and precision livestock management.

	abstract = {Welfare studies are increasingly involving the application of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) sensors, rather than the use of animal-based indicators directly assessed. PLF technology has the advantage to constantly monitor behavior over a long period of time, thus enabling the assessor to identify changes in animal time budgets in real-time. In calves, lying behavior is essential: new-borns have been reported to spend 70–80\% of their daily time lying. Growing up, calves progressively reduce the time spent lying; at 3 months, lying behavior occupies around the 50\% of their day. Several studies emphasize how lying behavior can be considered as a potential indicator of positive welfare in ruminants, including calves. The aim of this study was to critically revise scientific literature regarding the application of precision livestock farming technologies to measure lying, rest and sleep behaviors in dairy calves. A systematic literature search based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology was conducted through Scopus and Web of Science databases to retrieve full peer-reviewed papers written in English on different PLF technologies applied to measure lying behavior in dairy calves. Literature search retrieved 731 records. After duplicate removal and the application of inclusion criteria, a total of 16 papers were considered eligible for the evaluation. Different PLF technologies and approaches were reported to be used: triaxial accelerometers, machine learning with accelerometer data, computer vision with video cameras, wearable cameras and real-time locating system. Most of the papers (10 out of 16) reported the use of accelerometers, placed on different parts of body of the animal (hind leg, neck, head, ear). Considering the importance that lying behavior has for maintaining homeostasis and development of calves, the possibility to monitor it constantly and reliably with PLF technology would certainly provide a better understanding of calves’ behavior and positive welfare. However, our findings underline PLF technologies still show some practical limitations. Therefore, we must ensure that the sensors are valid and reliable before applying them in practice to detect changes that can be linked with welfare status of calves.},

	abstract = {Background
Livestock farming has increased in complexity considerably due to the growing demand for animal products combined with a decreasing number of farmers and ranchers. To meet this challenge, Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) aims to develop fully automated tools to continuously monitor animals, such as cattle, to detect issues earlier and improve productivity. The objective of this scoping review is to provide an overview of precision livestock farming technologies used for cattle monitoring.
Methods
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines were followed in this review. Peer-reviewed journal and conference papers from 2005 to 2023 were included, with a focus on technological systems used for cattle monitoring or disease detection. Extracted data included publication year, geographical region, type of technology used, type of monitoring, goal of the intervention, and the level of validation. The relationships between the technology, type of monitoring, and goal of intervention were also explored.
Results
413 papers were found to meet the eligibility criteria. The countries with the most papers were China (n = 55), Japan (n = 52), the United States (n = 38), Australia (n = 25), and India (n = 20). The most common types of technology were found to be inertial sensors (37 \%) and images or videos (35 \%). Simple classification methods were used in 48 \% of papers and machine learning in 29 \%. The two most common goals stated in PLF papers were determining animal behavior (30 \%) and animal health (12 \%).
Conclusion
Overall, the results provide a snapshot of the types and uses of technologies in PLF for cattle management and suggest emerging technologies and applications of these tools to improve cattle health and welfare.},

This study presents a bibliometric analysis focused on these technologies involving dairy farming to explore and map the extent of research in the scientific literature. Through this review, it was possible to investigate academic production related to digital and precision livestock farming and identify emerging patterns, main research themes, and author collaborations. To carry out this investigation in the literature, the entire timeline was considered, finding works from 2008 to November 2023 in the scientific databases Scopus and Web of Science. Next, the Bibliometrix (version 4.1.3) package in R (version 4.3.1) and its Biblioshiny software extension (version 4.1.3) were used as a graphical interface, in addition to the VOSviewer (version 1.6.19) software, focusing on filtering and creating graphs and thematic maps to analyze the temporal evolution of 198 works identified and classified for this research. The results indicate that the main journals of interest for publications with identified affiliations are “Computers and Electronics in Agriculture” and “Journal of Dairy Science”. It has been observed that the authors focus on emerging technologies such as machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision for behavioral monitoring, dairy cattle identification, and management of thermal stress in these animals. These technologies are crucial for making decisions that enhance health and efficiency in milk production, contributing to more sustainable practices. This work highlights the evolution of precision livestock farming and introduces the concept of digital livestock farming, demonstrating how the adoption of advanced digital tools can transform dairy herd management. Digital livestock farming not only boosts productivity but also redefines cattle management through technological innovations, emphasizing the significant impact of these trends on the sustainability and efficiency of dairy production.},

	abstract = {As the global human population increases, livestock agriculture must adapt to provide more livestock products and with improved efficiency while also addressing concerns about animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and public health. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the current state of the art in digitalizing animal agriculture with Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies, specifically biometric sensors, big data, and blockchain technology. Biometric sensors include either noninvasive or invasive sensors that monitor an individual animal’s health and behavior in real time, allowing farmers to integrate this data for population-level analyses. Real-time information from biometric sensors is processed and integrated using big data analytics systems that rely on statistical algorithms to sort through large, complex data sets to provide farmers with relevant trending patterns and decision-making tools. Sensors enabled blockchain technology affords secure and guaranteed traceability of animal products from farm to table, a key advantage in monitoring disease outbreaks and preventing related economic losses and food-related health pandemics. Thanks to PLF technologies, livestock agriculture has the potential to address the abovementioned pressing concerns by becoming more transparent and fostering increased consumer trust. However, new PLF technologies are still evolving and core component technologies (such as blockchain) are still in their infancy and insufficiently validated at scale. The next generation of PLF technologies calls for preventive and predictive analytics platforms that can sort through massive amounts of data while accounting for specific variables accurately and accessibly. Issues with data privacy, security, and integration need to be addressed before the deployment of multi-farm shared PLF solutions becomes commercially feasible.},

	abstract = {Traditional cattle production practices relied heavily on manual observation and empirical decision-making, often leading to inconsistent outcomes. In contrast, modern approaches leverage technology to achieve greater precision and efficiency. Advancement in technology has shifted to a new dimension of predictive and monitoring in cattle health management. This review aims at highlighting the available and current digital technologies in cattle health, evaluate their utility in practice, and identify possible future advancements in the field that can potentially bring even more changes to this industry. The paper highlights some of the barriers and disadvantages of using these technologies, such as data security issues, high capital investments, and skills gap. The integration of these advanced technologies is set to play a fundamental role in enabling the livestock industry to meet the rising global demand for high-quality, sustainably produced products. These technologies are essential for ensuring compliance with ethical standards and best practices in cattle care and well-being. In light of these advancements, the application of digital innovations will support the achievement of socially responsible cattle production, while simultaneously maintaining optimal levels of animal health and welfare.},

	abstract = {The demand for meat and dairy products is expected to rise significantly in the current demographic and economic growth context. Concurrently, various factors, including financial crises and reduced profitability, have decreased the number of livestock farms. Consequently, the livestock industry is undergoing intensification, with an increased number of cows per farm. This shift makes the management of animals increasingly complex. Amid these challenges, the society’s growing concern for animal health and welfare and the quality of consumed products underscores the importance of systems that aid in the individual and herd-level monitoring and control within livestock operations. In this scenario, precision livestock farming has become essential with the emergence of new sensors and technologies and the evolution of artificial intelligence. Against this backdrop, this paper reviews systems and techniques used in precision livestock farming to detect anomalies caused by reproductive processes and diseases in dairy and beef cattle. The article analyzes sensors and technologies employed, presents key studies conducted, and discusses the most commonly used artificial intelligence techniques in detecting prevalent anomalies.},

	abstract = {Since the 1980s, efforts have been made to develop sensors that measure a parameter from an individual cow. The development started with individual cow recognition and was followed by sensors that measure the electrical conductivity of milk and pedometers that measure activity. The aim of this review is to provide a structured overview of the published sensor systems for dairy health management. The development of sensor systems can be described by the following 4 levels: (I) techniques that measure something about the cow (e.g., activity); (II) interpretations that summarize changes in the sensor data (e.g., increase in activity) to produce information about the cow's status (e.g., estrus); (III) integration of information where sensor information is supplemented with other information (e.g., economic information) to produce advice (e.g., whether to inseminate a cow or not); and (IV) the farmer makes a decision or the sensor system makes the decision autonomously (e.g., the inseminator is called). This review has structured a total of 126 publications describing 139 sensor systems and compared them based on the 4 levels. The publications were published in the Thomson Reuters (formerly ISI) Web of Science database from January 2002 until June 2012 or in the proceedings of 3 conferences on precision (dairy) farming in 2009, 2010, and 2011. Most studies concerned the detection of mastitis (25\%), fertility (33\%), and locomotion problems (30\%), with fewer studies (16\%) related to the detection of metabolic problems. Many studies presented sensor systems at levels I and II, but none did so at levels III and IV. Most of the work for mastitis (92\%) and fertility (75\%) is done at level II. For locomotion (53\%) and metabolism (69\%), more than half of the work is done at level I. The performance of sensor systems varies based on the choice of gold standards, algorithms, and test sizes (number of farms and cows). Studies on sensor systems for mastitis and estrus have shown that sensor systems are brought to a higher level; however, the need to improve detection performance still exists. Studies on sensor systems for locomotion problems have shown that the search continues for the most appropriate indicators, sensor techniques, and gold standards. Studies on metabolic problems show that it is still unclear which indicator reflects best the metabolic problems that should be detected. No systems with integrated decision support models have been found.},
